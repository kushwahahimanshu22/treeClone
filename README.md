# tree command clone #

This a part of my OS course assignment series in MNIT Jaipur.

The program stores the directory structure for future uses.

The printTree function recursively prints the directory according to given flags.
Right now the program accepts 3 flags:
1) d - Display directory only
2) f - Display full path
3) a - Display hidden files
